## Why these Libraries
- React - As itâ€™s a widely adopted and efficient JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. It allows us to break the UI into reusable components, making development faster and easier to maintain.
- Material UI - For ready-made, responsive, and accessible UI components. It speeds up development by providing a polished and consistent design system that works well across devices.
- Context API - To manage and share the fetched data (repository list) across components. This keeps the state centralized and makes the code cleaner without needing a heavy state management library like Redux.
- Cypress - It provides a reliable way to write both component tests and end-to-end tests. It also offers a great visual interface for debugging tests in the browser.
